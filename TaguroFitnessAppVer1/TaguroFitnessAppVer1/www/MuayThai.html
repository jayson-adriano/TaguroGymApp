    <h1 align="center">MUAY THAI</h1>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">Muay Thai is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques.</p>

    <h2 align="left" style="margin-left:10px;">Why muay thai?</h2>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
        <b>Increased Cardiovascular Conditioning</b><br />
        I have played many sports and partaken in a large variety of physical activities over the years, and none of them have come close to delivering the cardiovascular conditioning that Muay Thai offer. Being both aerobic and anaerobic, Muay Thai places huge stress on your cardiopulmonary systems. With continued practice, your body will adapt to the demands of the sport, and improved cardiovascular performance is one of the payoffs.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Leg Strength</b><br />
        Kicking and footwork play a large role in Muay Thai. One movement that is distinctive to Muay thai is the roundhouse kick. Learning how to kick strengthens the musculature of the lower body. Every muscle in your lower body will benefit from practicing the various kicks and footwork drills incorporated in the sport. From muscle endurance, force production, agility, to just plain old good looking calves, Muay Thai delivers.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Core Strength</b><br />
        Core is not a word I like to use a lot. Generally when someone refers to their core, they're referring to their abdominal muscles. This drives strength and conditioning professionals crazy. Your core is every single muscle located on your trunk, not your damn six pack. But I digress. The rotational nature of all of the movements in the sport truly does strengthen your core. Getting punched in the body will also help a little. Striking, defensive movements, and clinching will all help the Muay Thai student develop a strong core.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Increased Hip Mobility</b><br />
        It won’t happen overnight, but with time the kicking and kneeing movements of Muay Thai promote increased hip mobility. Having healthy hips alone can save you from serious pain and numerous terrible medical conditions later in life. Just remember to do your foam rolling and stretching. Get an occasional massage and those hips of yours will feel amazing.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Stress Relief</b><br />
        I personally think this is the most important benefit Muay Thai can provide. The majority of us accumulate a fair amount of stress during the day. Having an outlet for that stress feels fantastic and can work wonders for your mental and physical health. Let's face it, when you're pissed off at work or stressed about bills, hitting something just feels good. Due to the fast-paced nature of the sport, you can’t trouble yourself with worry while training. You’ll get hit in the face or mess up the drill you're working on. Practicing a martial art allows you to focus on yourself and nothing else. I believe doing something regularly that detaches you from the daily grind helps you become a happier and more carefree individual.

        •	Mobility and stretching - 10 min <br/>

        • 50 push kicks <br/>
        Alternate right and left kicks. Work with the swing of the bag during this drill. As the bag swing towards you, stop it with your push kick. Also, make sure you use your footwork to develop your reaction time. Don’t just stand in front of the bag waiting for it. Move from side to side and circle the bag.<br />
        •	50 roundhouse kicks per leg<br />
        Complete all kicks on one side before switching to the other leg. During this drill, practice kicking to the leg, body, and head. Focus on maximizing rotation, speed, power, and retraction.<br />
        •	5 rounds freestyle<br />
        Feel free to mix it up during this portion of the training session. Use all of your weapons, footwork patterns, defensive techniques, and feints. Just remember to keep it simple when you work the bag. Don’t get caught up throwing fifteen-hit combinations. You will get the best bang for your buck sticking with simple strikes and movement patterns. Remember that what you practice on the bag will be what happens when you spar. Practice doesn’t make perfect - it makes habit.
