    <h1 align="center">ZUMBA</h1>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">An aerobic fitness program featuring movements inspired by various styles of Latin American dance and performed primarily to Latin American dance music.</p>

    <h2 align="left" style="margin-left:10px;">Why zumba?</h2>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
        <b>Effective calorie burner</b><br />
        According to the recent Zumba study sponsored by ACE and led by Dr. John Porcari, a person can burn an average of 369 calories (9.5 calories per minute) after doing a 38-minute class with an average heart rate of 154 beats per minute.<br />
        They also compared the calorie burn with other exercises studied in the past, and discovered that Zumba could help one burn more calories than step aerobics and cardio kickboxing.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Complete fitness program</b><br />
        Just like any complete fitness program, the class starts with a five- to 10-minute warm-up and ends with a cool down where flexibility moves are usually done. Resistance training moves such as lunges and squats are usually incorporated in the class either as warm-up or during the main workout.<br />
        You use your upper body the whole time as well, and this gives you more chance to develop your coordination. Most dance moves like salsa or merengue have equivalent fitness moves.<br />
        The whole workout is considered as a cardio workout that will help improve your heart health. You use your core almost the whole time to execute the moves gracefully and correctly, so you do not injure yourself, especially the back.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Long-term regimen</b><br />
        Most participants can stay in the program long-term, that’s why they can control their weight and maintain and continue to improve their fitness level.<br/>
        Zumba fitness uses fantastic Latin and even popular music like “Party Rock Anthem” to make the class enjoyable.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Stress therapy</b><br />
        Zumba can also be considered as effective therapy for some emotional hardships and stressors such as loss of loved one, personal difficulties, because during the class you can manage to smile, be with other positive people and enjoy a great way to express yourself.
