    <h1 align="center">TAEKWONDO</h1>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">Tae Kwon Do is the art of self-defense that originated in Korea. It is recognized as one of the oldest forms of martial arts in the world, reaching back over 2000 years. The name was selected for its appropriate description of the art: Tae (foot), Kwon (hand), and Do (art).</p>

    <h2 align="left" style="margin-left:10px;">Why taekwondo?</h2>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
        <b>Cardio and circulation. </b><br />
        Taekwondo requires you to engage all of your muscle groups, so it offers a good cardio workout. It gets your heart pumping and improves circulation throughout the body. Practicing for just 30 minutes a day can give you all the exercise you need for a more active lifestyle.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Fat loss. </b><br />
        As your heart rate increases, your blood circulation improves, and various muscle groups get activated. Your body is forced to burn calories. Steady and regular workouts can ultimately result in substantial, healthy weight loss.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Muscle toning. </b><br />
        According to a post from Taekwondo-Information.org, “One of the physical benefits of taekwondo training is that it strengthens our muscles, bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments.” The most noticeable effect will be on the muscles. While taekwondo alone may not help you increase muscle mass, it will tone muscles as fat is reduced and muscles become more active.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Increased flexibility. </b><br />
        At the beginning of each taekwondo training session, most instructors spend a few minutes stretching. Over time, this will increase your flexibility. In turn, it prevents you from pulling muscles and hurting joints during your day-to-day routine.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Improved stamina. </b><br />
        As your muscles become stronger and your heart more active, your overall stamina level will increase. This should enable you to work out longer and not get as tired.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Stress relief. </b><br />
        Similar to many other physical activities and exercises, taekwondo helps relieve stress and diminishes the intensity of such physical ailments as muscle tension, headaches and chronic pain. Taekwondo becomes as much a physical exercise as a mental one.
